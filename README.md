This repo provides a toolkit for developing skills related to taking the GRE exam. For math, you can practice multiplication tables and mental math skills. For vocab, you can add vocab and test this vocab based on the examples and definitions. For spelling, you can practice some of the most commonly mispelled words.

This is still in development.
